# myTestGallery
Hi!
I know that i perform this task far from perfection, and even far from task actually was. But i saw Robotlegs and Flash Builder first time in my life week ago, and few days i read documentation and best practices. I took existed test project of Robotlegs Flickr Gallery for save time with creating new project, classes structure etc. And this also caused problems - I needed to fix some their bugs in tutorial so now you can see my commit in Robotlegs official tutorial project - https://github.com/robotlegs/robotlegs-demos-Bundle/pull/3#event-402878761 :) 

I on purpose didn't search for bin-packing algorythmes and created some from nothing. It isn't ideal, but more days of this week i spend for learning Robotlegs and working with mxml components, so algorythm was on the second place.

I didn't create Maven configuration form Extra task 1, but in GalleryModel class you can find method ExtraTaskArraySorting for Extra task 2.

And about Extra question. Result of @myVal % 2 && trace(@myVal) will be zero when myVal is even and myVal if it's odd, but code is working only if make it this - xmlData.children().(xmlData.children().@myVal % 2 && trace(xmlData.children().@myVal)) and still all compression returns nothing, except each @myVal few times. i read the question in few minutes before final commit, so i can't definatly say the meaning of this expression.

Thank you for interesting tasks, learning of new frameworks and tools was challenging, and i think i'll continue with it!
